# Monopolio


## CMS

The Monopolio site runs on Kirby, a file-based CMS. Learn more at [getkirby.com](https://getkirby.com).

## Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**

### Requirements

Kirby runs on PHP 7.1+, Apache or Nginx.
