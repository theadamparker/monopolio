# Monopolio


## Photo Styles
The site uses a few primary photo layouts that can be managed differently.
- *Featured photo*: This spans half of the page, and sits beside a section headline and intro.
- *Gallery photo*: This is one-third of a page, and sits below a featured photo.

These are referenced in preset `srcset` definitions, and can be used like this:
```
$image->srcset('featuredPhoto');
$image->srcset('galleryPhoto');
```

## CMS

The Monopolio site runs on Kirby, a file-based CMS. Learn more at [getkirby.com](https://getkirby.com).

## Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**

### Requirements

Kirby runs on PHP 7.1+, Apache or Nginx.
