Headline1: In Honor of a Mexican Tradition

----

Text1: In 1860 a Frenchman sailed across the Atlantic to St Louis, Missouri where he would master his skills as a brewer. After the Civil War broke out he traveled south to Mexico. A chance meeting with a local farmer from San Luis Potosi allowed for the right mix of skills and ingredients to brew cerveza. They ultimately founded the Cerveceria de San Luis, a grand brewery and proud symbol of the advancements of the time.

Headline2: Non Plus Ultra

----

Text2: 

Short for “Non Terre Plus Ultra” or “no land farther beyond,” was a popular moto before the discovery of the New World. Spain later adopted “Plus Ultra” or “more beyond” referring to Columbus’ discovery. Today you can find the motto on the Spanish Flag, featured across the pillars of Hercules. The Cerveceria de San Luis’ original founders proudly displayed their own interpretation in 1900:

**“The beer of the land further beyond.”**
